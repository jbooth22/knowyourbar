## Brand review pages — TEMPLATE_BRAND.html

All brand pages have been rebuilt from scratch using TEMPLATE_BRAND.html. This is the locked standard. Every future brand page must use this template.

### Template section order
1. Head: title, meta description, canonical, 4 JSON-LD schemas, OG/Twitter tags
2. Nav
3. Hero (H1 + short answer paragraph)
4. Scorecard snapshot (6 stats: flavors, grade range, score range, protein, calories, sweetener status)
5. Overview summary (2-3 paragraphs)
6. Grade distribution bar
7. Best and worst flavor cards (with chips)
8. Macro breakdown grid (6 macros) + SEO blurb
9. Ingredient quality patterns (chip frequency)
10. Full flavor table (6 columns: Flavor, Grade, Score, Protein, Cal, Sugar)
11. Bottom line (2 paragraphs)
12. Explore all bars CTA (dark tile, p tag not h2, 3 filter buttons)
13. Explore more (3 link cards with descriptions, div not h2)
14. FAQ section (7 questions minimum)
15. Footer (brand-block left, nav right, copy div OUTSIDE site-footer-inner)

### Flavor table structure
- 6 columns only — no Insights column in the table header
- Chips live inside the expand row (.ingr-chips), not in the table
- Expand row contains: ingr-macros strip, ingredient list, ingr-chips, ingr-buy button
- colspan must be 6 on all ingr rows
- toggleIngr index starts at 0 and increments per row

### JSON-LD schemas required on every brand page
1. Article (with url, image, datePublished, dateModified, about)
2. Dataset (static, same on every page)
3. BreadcrumbList (3 levels: Home > Brand Reviews > Page)
4. FAQPage (minimum 7 questions, must match visible FAQ exactly)

### SEO rules
- og:type must be "article" on brand pages (not "website")
- Title formula: "Are [BRAND] Bars Healthy? We Scored All [N] Flavors | Know Your Bar"
- Meta description: lead with a specific data point, under 155 chars, no em dashes
- H1: one per page, matches title formula
- H2: content sections only — CTA title uses p tag, Explore More uses div

---

## Guide pages — TEMPLATE_GUIDE.html

All lifestyle guide pages have been rebuilt from TEMPLATE_GUIDE.html. This is the locked standard for all guide pages including the diabetics page.

### Template section order
1. Head: title, meta description, canonical, 4 JSON-LD schemas, OG/Twitter tags
2. Nav
3. Hero (H1 + short answer paragraph, hero sub text color: #e8e4dc)
4. Snapshot stats (uses .snapshot / .snap-item pattern — bar count, grade breakdown, key macro)
5. Top Picks (3 goal cards — .picks-grid with grade badge, brand, flavor, macros, buy links)
6. Category explainer + key factors (.score-card callouts with stat + description)
7. Findings dark section (.findings with .big-stat + .insights-grid)
8. Best brands / brands to avoid (.verdict-card pro/con)
9. Bar list table (columns vary by guide — default: Bar, Grade, Score, Protein, Cal, Sugar)
10. Bar Finder CTA (.explore-cta linking to pre-filtered tool URL)
11. Explore More (3 .explore-more-card links)
12. FAQ (7+ questions, must match JSON-LD exactly)
13. Footer

### Guide table notes
- First 25 rows visible, rows 26+ hidden with class="hidden-bar" and Show More toggle
- Keto guide uses Fat + Net Carbs columns instead of Calories + Sugar — patch manually if template is updated
- Diabetics guide uses 5-filter criteria: sugar, net carbs, fiber, no maltitol

### JSON-LD schemas required on every guide page
1. Article
2. Dataset (static, same as brand pages)
3. BreadcrumbList
4. FAQPage (minimum 7 questions, must match visible FAQ exactly)

### Disclaimer rule (diabetics page and similar)
Pages targeting health conditions must include a visible disclaimer: "We are not doctors or dieticians. These are the qualities we know people look for, so that's what we factored in."

## Brand Standards v1 migration — READ BEFORE TOUCHING COLORS OR BUTTONS

`BRAND_STANDARDS.md` defines a locked future visual system (`--bs-ink`, `--bs-paper`, ink-stamp buttons, Barlow Condensed, sentence case, no uppercase mono labels). It is **not fully live**. Current actual state:
- `style.css` has both token sets defined: the legacy `--black`/`--white`/`--accent` tokens (still what nearly every page actually renders with) and the new `--bs-*` tokens (used only in scoped `.brand-v1` overrides).
- Almost every page now has `<body class="brand-v1">`, but that only activates a handful of specific overrides already written into style.css — it does **not** mean the page has been rebuilt to the new spec. Check `BRAND_STANDARDS.md`'s migration checklist for which pages are actually done.
- Recent work (buy button standardization, boost badges) was done against the **legacy** token set, since that's what's actually rendering. Don't assume a full `--bs-*` rebuild is imminent — check with the site owner before investing in new legacy-system polish vs. waiting for the v1 migration on any given page.
- Before adding any new color, button style, or type treatment: check `BRAND_STANDARDS.md` first. If the page isn't migrated yet, match the existing legacy pattern on that page rather than introducing `--bs-*` tokens piecemeal.

---

## CSS architecture — READ BEFORE TOUCHING ANYTHING

**style.css is the single source of truth for all styles.**

- index.html has an inline `<style>` block for homepage-only CSS (hero, stats bar, sample card, grade strip, finder section, goal cards). This is intentional — do not move it to style.css.
- Brand/guide pages have minimal inline CSS (just :root vars). Everything else from style.css.
- style.css is 3,700+ lines. Do not replace it wholesale. Only append or use targeted str_replace.

### CSS variables (defined in style.css :root)
```css
--black:      #0e0e0e
--white:      #f7f5f0
--off-white:  #efece6
--accent:     #d4f000   /* yellow-green */
--muted:      #888880
--border:     #d6d3cc
--font-display: 'DM Sans', sans-serif /* headings — Syne was removed (single-story 'g' clipping); never reintroduce it */
--font-mono:    'DM Mono', monospace  /* labels, stats */
--font-body:    'DM Sans', sans-serif /* body text */
--radius:     6px
--radius-lg:  10px
```

### Page type classes
- Brand review pages: `<body class="page-brand">`
- Guide pages: `<body class="page-guide">`
- index.html: plain `<body>`
- Nearly all pages also carry `<body class="brand-v1">` — this opts them into partial BRAND_STANDARDS v1 overrides (see "Brand Standards v1 migration" below). It does not mean the page is fully migrated.

### New CSS classes added in April/May 2026
These exist in style.css and should not be duplicated:
- `.bw-chips` — chip row inside best/worst cards
- `.macro-summary-text` — accent-left blurb after macro grid
- `.explore-cta`, `.explore-cta-inner`, `.explore-cta-eyebrow`, `.explore-cta-title`, `.explore-cta-sub`, `.explore-cta-btns`, `.explore-cta-btn` — dark CTA tile
- `.explore-more-label`, `.explore-more-grid`, `.explore-more-card`, `.explore-more-title`, `.explore-more-desc` — explore more link cards
- `.ingr-macros` — macro strip inside expand rows
- `.ingr-chips` — chip row inside expand rows
- `.ingr-buy` — buy button inside expand rows
- `.site-footer-brand-block` — footer brand+tagline wrapper
- `.site-nav-mobile-bar-finder` — pinned Bar Finder button in mobile nav (always visible, outside hamburger)

### New CSS classes added in July 2026
- `.boost-badges`, `.boost-badge` — small indigo pills under the flavor name in the bar-finder results table, flagging Caffeine / Creatine / Vitamins as differentiators. Vitamin badge triggers at >2% DV on any single vitamin (not mineral) field — see `VITAMIN_DV_THRESHOLD` constant in `app.js`. Do not reuse this color for anything else; it's reserved for these three supplement flags.

### Buy button conventions (locked July 2026 — do not deviate)
Every "buy" link on the site follows one of exactly two styles, regardless of page:
- **Primary — "Buy on Amazon":** solid black background (`var(--black)`), white text. Classes: `.amazon-link` (bar-finder detail panel), `.cmp-buy-btn` (comparison table), `.buy-btn` (guide/brand listing cards), `.cta-amazon`, `.bar-link-amz`, `.bar-buy-btn`.
- **Secondary — "Buy from Brand":** transparent background, black text, black border (outlined, not solid). Classes: `.visit-link` (bar-finder detail panel), `.cmp-site-btn` (comparison table), `.bar-link-site` (guide/brand listing cards).
Both classes for a given context should always render side by side with the primary (solid) first. **Never use orange (`#FF9900` or similar) for any buy button** — that was the pre-July-2026 default and has been fully removed sitewide. If a new page or template needs a buy button, copy one of the six primary classes above; do not invent a new one.

### Homepage-only CSS classes (in index.html inline style block)
- `.hero-trust` — time/ease anchor line under the CTA button
- `.hero-a-row`, `.hero-a-names`, `.hero-a-sep`, `.hero-a-all` — A-rated bar name row in hero
- `.hero-sample`, `.hero-sample-card`, `.hero-sample-header`, `.hero-sample-badge`, `.hero-sample-bar-*`, `.hero-sample-chip`, `.hero-sample-macros` — sample bar result card
- `.trust-strip`, `.trust-strip-mark`, `.trust-strip-quote` — trust strip between stats bar and finder
- `.goal-card--featured` — "Show me the best" featured goal card variant

### Hard rules — never break these
1. Never use regex to strip or modify CSS inside `<style>` tags
2. Never replace style.css entirely — only append or use targeted str_replace
3. Never remove a wrapper `<div>` without checking div balance afterwards
4. After ANY HTML change: run the div balance check in QA.md
5. After ANY JS change: run `node --check app.js`
6. Always work from the actual uploaded file, not from memory of previous sessions

## index.html hero — current structure (May 2026)

The homepage hero has been significantly updated. Current structure in order:

1. Eyebrow: "The Protein Bar Database · No Sponsored Picks"
2. H1: "Every protein bar scored A-F on ingredient quality"
3. Subhead: "1,000+ bars graded A-F — see which ones actually pass. No affiliate deals, no brand payments. See how we score →"
4. CTA button: "Find My Bar →" (accent yellow, single button only — secondary button removed)
5. Trust anchor: "Answer 3 questions · Get your match in 30 seconds" (directly under button)
6. A-rated bar row: "Top A-rated bars: RXBAR Chocolate Sea Salt · Perfect Bar Dark Chocolate · IQ Bar Lemon Blueberry → See all 150+ A-rated bars"
7. Sample bar result card: Atlas Salted Peanut Butter — B grade, score 6, real chips and macros from database
8. (End of hero)

**Do not add a secondary CTA button.** The "How We Score" link lives as inline text in the subhead only.

## Writing rules — apply everywhere on this site

This site must read like a knowledgeable person wrote it, not an AI. These rules are non-negotiable and apply to every page, every section, every sentence.

**Never use:**
- Em dashes ( — ) anywhere. Not in copy, not in meta descriptions, not in JSON-LD
- "It is worth noting"
- "It is important to"
- "Furthermore" / "Moreover" / "Additionally"
- "Delve" / "Leverage" / "Robust" / "Utilize" / "Crucial"
- "This is a deliberate brand strategy"
- Passive constructions that soften direct claims
- Filler qualifiers that pad without adding meaning

**Always use:**
- Short, direct sentences
- Specific numbers rather than vague descriptors
- Active voice
- Plain English verdicts — state what the data shows, don't hedge everything
- Second person ("you") when addressing the reader directly

**Tone:** Knowledgeable, direct, slightly opinionated but always data-backed. Think a trusted friend who has actually read all the ingredient labels, not a product reviewer covering their bases.

---

## The bar database (bars.js)

Each bar object has these key fields:
```
Brand Name, Flavor Name, score_band (A/B/C/D/F), ingredient_score (numeric),
Calories, Protein (g), Total Fat (g), Saturated Fat (g), Total Carbohydrates (g),
Dietary Fiber (g), Sugars (g), Sugar Alcohol (g), Sodium (mg), Cholesterol (mg),
Ingredients (full text), Amazon Affiliate (URL), Website (URL),
positive_ingredients, concern_ingredients,
Vegan (Y/N), Gluten Free (Y/N), Dairy Free (Y/N), Soy Free (Y/N),
Non-GMO (Y/N), Nut Free (Y/N), Kosher (Y/N)
```

Grade colors: A=#2a7a1f, B=#5a8a2f, C=#b89a00, D=#c87020, F=#c83020
Grade definitions: A=Clean, B=Good, C=Okay, D=Poor, F=Avoid

Net carbs formula: Total Carbs - Fiber - (Sugar Alcohol / 2)

### Building brand pages from bars.js
When building or rebuilding a brand page, always extract data directly from bars.js using node or Python. Do not rely on the old HTML page for ingredient data — it may be inaccurate. The pipeline:
1. Filter bars.js by brand name (check for all sub-brands, e.g. "Clif Builders", "Clif ZBar")
2. Sort by ingredient_score descending
3. Use exact ingredient text, amazon affiliate URL, and macro data from the database
4. Build rows using the template row pattern from TEMPLATE_BRAND.html

---

## Scoring pipeline

Bars scored using `score_and_export.py` against `knowyourbar_scoring_schema_v4.xlsx`
- 1,163 canonical ingredients
- 2,194 aliases
- Sub-ingredients in parentheses get 60% weight
- 150+ A-rated bars in current database

### Grade bands (v4 schema)
| Grade | Label | Score range |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| A | Clean | >= 8.0 |
| B | Good | 4.0 to 7.9 |
| C | Okay | 0.0 to 3.9 |
| D | Poor | -3.0 to -0.1 |
| F | Avoid | < -3.0 |

### Count adjustment
| Ingredient count | Adjustment |
|-----------------|------------|
| 1-8 | +0.05 |
| 9-12 | 0.00 |
| 13-16 | -0.05 |
| 17-20 | -0.10 |
| 21+ | -0.15 |

To rescore: upload new bar Excel + schema file and say "run score_and_export"

---

## Current site features (index.html + app.js)

### Filter panel
- Lifestyle presets: Lose Weight, Clean Ingredients, Skip the Sugar, High Protein, Keto Friendly
- Ingredient Quality Grade: A/B/C/D/F toggle buttons
- Brand filter: searchable multi-select
- Flavor keyword text search
- Macro sliders: Protein (min), Calories (max), Fat (max), Carbs (max), Sugars (max), Sugar Alcohol (max), Fiber (min), Net Carbs (max)
- Certifications: Vegan, GF, DF, SF, Non-GMO, Nut Free
- Exclude ingredients: text input, XSS-safe

### Preset deep links — VALID SLUGS ONLY
Brand and guide pages link to the bar finder with `/?preset=SLUG`. Only these 5 slugs are defined in `app.js` — any other value silently does nothing:

| Slug | Label | Criteria |
|------|-------|----------|
| `lose_weight` | Lose Weight | 20g+ protein, under 200 cal, under 3g sugar, A/B grade |
| `clean` | Clean Ingredients | A grade, 12g+ protein, no artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols |
| `skip_sugar` | Skip the Sugar | Under 2g sugar, under 4g sugar alcohol, no maltitol/sorbitol, A/B grade |
| `high_protein` | High Protein | Highest protein efficiency (g per calorie), 15g+ protein, A/B/C grade |
| `keto` | Keto Friendly | Under 5g net carbs, 10g+ fat, A/B grade |

**Never invent preset slugs.** If a guide topic doesn't map cleanly to one of these, use the closest match or link to `/?` (unfiltered) with a relevant label.

### Results table columns
BAR | CAL | PROT | P/100 | FAT | CARB | FIBR | SGR | SGR ALC | CERTS | GRADE | CMP

P/100 = Protein grams per 100 calories (sortable)

Under the flavor name in the BAR cell, Caffeine/Creatine/Vitamins boost badges render when present (see `.boost-badge` above) — not a table column, but part of that cell's content.

### Bar expand
Shows: macro rank grid, nutrition facts panel, ingredient quality score, certifications, ingredient list, similar bars, buy links

## SEO structure

Every page has:
- Unique title and meta description
- Canonical link
- FAQPage JSON-LD schema
- Article JSON-LD schema (brand/guide pages)
- Dataset JSON-LD schema
- BreadcrumbList JSON-LD schema (brand pages)
- Open Graph tags
- GA4 tracking

Meta description strategy: lead with a specific surprising data point, not a generic description. No em dashes.

**llms.txt** lives at `/llms.txt` in the repo root. It documents the scoring system, database, brand reviews, and guides for AI crawlers (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.). Update it when adding new brand pages or guide pages.

---

## What's working well
- Mobile experience (62% of traffic) — priority to maintain
- Filter panel and bar expand on desktop
- XSS patched (exclusion tags use DOM methods)
- Brand review pages all rebuilt to consistent TEMPLATE_BRAND.html
- Guide pages all rebuilt to consistent TEMPLATE_GUIDE.html
- SEO schemas complete on all brand and guide pages
- ingredient_scoring.html fixed (horizontal scroll, grade bands table, copy)
- Sitemap updated — all live pages indexed
- Page speed grade A-93
- Cloudflare cache headers configured via _headers file

---

## Known issues / next priorities

### CSS
- Footer layout on brand pages may still have a stacking issue — verify on mobile before marking resolved

### Content
- KIND Minis and Thins not yet in database — pending scoring
- Some duplicate ASINs in bars.js: Barebells Caramel Peanut/Salted Peanut Caramel share B0DT7KS2QB; Clif ZBar Chocolate Mint and Clif Bar Cool Mint Chocolate share B0CXQ71XY8; Clif Builders Chocolatey Peanut Butter and Crispy Peanut Butter Chocolate share B09QHBBGJT
- Trust strip on homepage uses founder statement placeholder — swap for a real external quote (Reddit mention, press) when available

### Future features
- Protein type filter (whey vs plant vs egg)
- Net carbs column in main table
- Brand comparison pages (Quest vs Barebells, RXBAR vs KIND, Clif vs KIND, Quest vs ONE Bar)
- More brand review pages: Perfect Bar, GoMacro, ONE Bar, IQBar, Aloha, Built Bar
- More guide pages: best bars for weight loss, bars with real food ingredients
- ~~bars with caffeine~~ — done, see `caffeine-protein-bars.html`
- ~~bars with vitamins~~ — partially covered by the Vitamins boost badge in the main finder table (July 2026); a dedicated guide page is still open if wanted

## Deploy process

1. Make changes in Claude
2. Run QA script from QA.md — must pass before upload
3. Download files from Claude
4. Upload to GitHub repo (drag and drop to repo root)
5. Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys within ~60 seconds
6. Purge Cloudflare cache if changes not showing
7. Test with `?v=N` query string to bypass browser cache during testing

### Rollback
Go to GitHub → file → History → find last working commit → download raw → re-upload

---

## Session discipline — how to work with Claude efficiently

**Start every session:**
1. Upload this BRIEFING.md
2. Upload the specific files you want to change (from GitHub)
3. State exactly what you want changed

**During session:**
- Claude works from uploaded files, not memory
- Claude runs verification checks before presenting output files
- Upload and verify before moving to the next change

**Never:**
- Ask Claude to change fonts/styles across all pages at once
- Let Claude use regex to modify HTML structure
- Upload files without seeing verification pass first
- Assume Claude remembers anything from a previous session — always upload BRIEFING.md

---

*This briefing is the single source of truth for working on this project.*
*Everything Claude needs is in this file plus whatever files you upload.*
